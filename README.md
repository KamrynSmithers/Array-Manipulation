How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
In this activity, the push() method allowed me to add the items typed at the end of the array, so my most important to-do items were still at the top ready to be completed and removed. The filter () method is another method I used to manipulate the data in this activity. By using this method I was able to create a "new" array that only contained the items I put into the search critera.  

What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
A challenge I encounted when trying to filter/search items in the array was, again, figuring out the syntax for the function. Due to SYNTAX being a repeated challenge, I will expand my knowledge and dedicate more time outside out class. 

How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
To make this code more user-friendly, I would add comments detailing my thought process behind some of the functions.
